# Sentiment Prediction for Movie Review


## Overview

Sentiment Prediction for Movie Review is a machine learning project designed to analyze and predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in movie reviews. This project encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis ensure high-quality input for the models.

- **Statistical Tests**: Statistical tests are employed to validate hypotheses and assess feature significance.

- **Handling Missing Values**: Techniques are implemented to handle missing data gracefully.

- **Feature Engineering**: New features are created and existing ones are transformed to improve model performance.

- **Outlier Handling**: Outliers are identified and addressed to mitigate their impact on predictions.

- **Feature Encoding and Transformation**: Categorical features are encoded, and numeric features are transformed as necessary.

- **Text to Numeric Conversion**: Text data is converted into numerical vectors using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and support vector machines, are applied to the sentiment analysis task.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Model hyperparameters are fine-tuned to optimize performance.

- **Model Comparison**: The performance of different models is compared using standard evaluation metrics.
